****Time Series Analysis of Avocado Prices with Prophet****

**Short Description**
In this code, I have trained a single forecasting model using the Prophet library, which is a popular tool for time series forecasting developed by Facebook. The model is trained to #forecast avocado prices based on historical data.

The key steps involved in training this model are:
1 Loading and preprocessing the data (including handling missing values).
2 Performing exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand the data.
3 Preparing the data specifically for Prophet by renaming columns to 'ds' (for date) and 'y' (for the variable to be forecasted, in this case, 'AveragePrice').
4 Training the Prophet model with the prepared data.
5 Making future predictions (forecasts) for a specified number of days (365 days in your code).
6 Plotting the forecasted results and components.
