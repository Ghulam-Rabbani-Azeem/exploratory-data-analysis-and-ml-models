# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification

**Short Description**
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The project includes the following steps:

1. Loading the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Visualizing some images from the dataset.
3. Preprocessing the data (normalizing and converting labels to one-hot encoding).
4. Building the CNN model.
5. Compiling and training the CNN model.
6. Evaluating the model on the test set.
7. Predicting classes for the test set and visualizing some predictions.
8. Generating and visualizing a confusion matrix.
9. Saving the trained model.
